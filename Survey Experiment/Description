This project involves a survey experiment aimed at examining the relationship between narcissism and feelings of dissatisfaction 
with one's country's status. I developed and conducted this survey experiment, subsequently analyzing the gathered data.

A survey experiment with a randomized control group is a research method used to determine the impact of a particular variable 
or treatment on a group of participants. In this context, participants are randomly assigned to either a control group or an 
experimental group. The control group typically does not receive the treatment or intervention being studied, while the experimental 
group does. By randomly assigning participants, researchers can minimize bias and ensure that any differences observed between the two 
groups are due to the treatment being studied rather than other factors. This method allows for more robust conclusions about cause and 
effect relationships between variables.
